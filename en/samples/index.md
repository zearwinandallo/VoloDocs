### Book Store

A simple CRUD application to demonstrate the basics of an application development. The same sample was implemented with different technologies:

- **Book Store: Razor Pages (MVC) UI & Entity Framework Core**
  - [Tutorial](https://docs.abp.io/en/commercial/latest/tutorials/book-store/part-1?UI=MVC&DB=EF)
  - [Download the source code](https://abp.io/Account/Login?returnUrl=/api/download/samples/bookstore-mvc-ef)
- **Book Store: Blazor UI & Entity Framework Core**
  - [Tutorial](https://docs.abp.io/en/commercial/latest/tutorials/book-store/part-1?UI=Blazor&DB=EF)
  - [Download the source code](https://abp.io/Account/Login?returnUrl=/api/download/samples/bookstore-blazor-efcore)
- **Book Store: Angular UI & MongoDB**
  - [Tutorial](https://docs.abp.io/en/commercial/latest/tutorials/book-store/part-1?UI=NG&DB=Mongo)
  - [Download the source code](https://abp.io/Account/Login?returnUrl=/api/download/samples/bookstore-angular-mongodb)

While there is no Razor Pages & MongoDB combination, you can check both documents to understand it since DB & UI selection don't effect each other.

## ABP Framework Samples

Also see the [open source sample applications](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Samples/Index) built with the ABP framework.
