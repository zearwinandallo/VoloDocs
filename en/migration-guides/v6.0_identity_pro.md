# ABP 6.0 Identity Pro Breaking Change

We created two new permissions in 6.0 to manage a user's `roles` and `organizations`.

```cs
IdentityPermissions.Users.ManageRoles
IdentityPermissions.Users.ManageOU
```
The admin's user does not have these permissions after the existing application is upgraded to 6.0, please remember to grant permissions to the relevant users.
