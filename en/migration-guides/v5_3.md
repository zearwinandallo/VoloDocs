# ABP Version 5.3 Migration Guide

This document is a guide for upgrading ABP 5.2 solutions to ABP 5.3. Please read them all since 5.3 has some changes you should take care of.

> See the [ABP Framework migration guide](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/5.3/Migration-Guides/Abp-5_3) for the changes made in the ABP Framework.

## Saas - Payment Module Dependency Improvements

* **Saas Module** no longer depends on the **Payment Module**. Projects that depend on only the **Saas module** but use payment/subscription features should also add `Volo.Payment.*` module packages.

* Solutions that include **Saas Module** and **Payment Module** together should configure `AbpSaasPaymentOptions` while migrating to v5.3 like below:

```csharp
Configure<AbpSaasPaymentOptions>(options =>
{
    options.IsPaymentSupported = true;
});
```
