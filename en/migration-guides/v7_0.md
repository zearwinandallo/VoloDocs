# ABP Commercial Version 7.0 Migration Guide

This document is a guide for upgrading ABP Commercial 6.x solutions to ABP Commercial 7.0. Please read them all since 7.0 has some changes you should take care of.

> ABP Commercial upgraded to .NET 7.0, so you need to move your solutions to .NET 7.0 if you want to use the ABP 7.0. You can check the [Migrate from ASP.NET Core 6.0 to 7.0](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/migration/60-70?view=aspnetcore-7.0) documentation. Also, see the [ABP Framework migration guide](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/7.0/Migration-Guides/Abp-7_0) for the changes made in the ABP Framework.

## "Manage Host Features" Moved to the Settings Page

The "Manage Host Features" button has been moved from Tenants page to the Settings page (under the *Feature Management* section).

## External Localization System in the Language Management Module

External Localization System is introduced in v7.0 to provide a way of accessing localizations in a distributed system. Two new database table are added with this feature: `AbpLocalizationResources` and `AbpLocalizationTexts`.

Thus, if you are using EF Core, you should add a new database migration and apply it to your database.

In addition to that, `LanguageTextConsts.MaxValueLength` is changed from 64 mb to 64 kb.
