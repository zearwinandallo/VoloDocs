## Payment Plan Management Permissions Moved to the Host Side

In this version, the payment plan management permissions (payment plan, gateway, and payment request permissions) have been moved to the host side. These permissions could have been visible on both sides prior to this version (tenants and hosts). However, a tenant can't configure its own payment gateway configurations by default, therefore it was not beneficial and logical. 

As a result, we decided to move these permissions to the host side and it will be only visible on the host side furthermore.
