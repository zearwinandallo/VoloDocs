# Communications Between Microservices

There are two basic messaging patterns for communication between two microservices:

## Synchronous Communication

In this pattern, a service calls an API that another service exposes,  using a protocol such as HTTP or gRPC. This option is a synchronous  messaging pattern because the caller waits for a response from the  receiver.

## Asynchronous Communication

In this pattern, a service sends message without waiting for a response, and one or more services process the message asynchronously. This is done by using a message broker or event bus.
